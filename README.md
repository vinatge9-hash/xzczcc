# PowerHouse Fitness - Gym Website

This package contains a complete, production-ready gym website built with Tailwind CSS (via CDN) and a minimal, responsive design.

- index.html: Home page with hero, services, testimonials, and call-to-action.
- about.html: About page with team and facility overview.
- contact.html: Contact form with basic client-side handling.
- README.md: This document.

How to run:
1. Open index.html in any modern browser. No server required.
2. All pages are interconnected via internal links (Home, About, Contact).

Design notes:
- 100% Tailwind CSS classes; no external CSS files.
- Phase-2 build for a complete, category-based site (Gym).
- Uses background hero image placeholders as described in the spec:

- Update content to reflect your brand voice and offerings.
- You can add more pages by duplicating a pattern from index.html and updating navigation links.

- Semantic HTML elements used (header, nav, main, section, footer).
- Keyboard-friendly navigation and focus states via Tailwind defaults.
